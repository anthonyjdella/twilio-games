/**
 * Procedural course generator — produces a fresh, *fair* gauntlet of barriers and
 * boost pads each race (call with a per-race seed). "Smart, not just random":
 *
 *  - SOLVABLE: every z-row leaves at least one barrier-free lane, so no wall is
 *    ever un-dodgeable.
 *  - REACTION RUNWAY: consecutive barrier rows are spaced >= MIN_BARRIER_GAP apart.
 *    The game is voice-controlled (~1s STT latency) so a player must have time to
 *    react to a hazard they see ahead. Boost rows can pack tighter (they reward,
 *    not punish).
 *  - DIFFICULTY RAMP (MODERATE, tuned for voice latency): barrier probability climbs
 *    0.35→0.65 and blocked-lane count climbs to at most ~3 of 5 (always >=2 open lanes),
 *    while barrier SPACING widens with progress. So it gets harder toward the finish but
 *    never brutal — you always have >=2 lanes to aim for and growing reaction runway.
 *  - RISK / REWARD: a guaranteed early boost teaches the mechanic; later boosts
 *    tend to sit in the riskier lanes near barriers.
