// ONE source of truth for the "how to play" legend, shown on the lobby screen before a race. This
// game is played BY VOICE over a phone call (Twilio Conversation Relay), so the legend teaches the
// SPOKEN commands — no keyboard keys are shown anywhere (the shared screen isn't how you drive).
//
// Not player-specific (it's just "here's what to shout"), so it's safe on a shared screen with many
// players — unlike the live personal gauge, which we gate to a single local player.
